# staking_platform

This is a simple staking dapp.

Users can stake their ETH on the platform by the specified deadline. 
After the deadline has passed, two things can happen: if the staking $ threshold has been met, the funds will be sent to another staking contract. If not, users will be able to withdraw their funds.
